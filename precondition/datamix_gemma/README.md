# `Datamix`: Data mixture selection for LLM fine-tuning

Authors: Shivam Gupta, Vlad Feinberg, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan, Peter Bartlett

This project studies data mixture selection strategies for LLM fine-tuning. The goal is to learn a distribution over k datasets, such that SFT using this distribution maximizes performance on a downstream evaluation.
